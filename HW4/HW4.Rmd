### Question 1

The responder gets 0 utility if they reject the offer, and t utility if they accept it where t is the amount the propoeser proposes. So to maximize utility, the responder's best response function is to choose to accept the proposal when X-t>0 and reject otherwise.

We can create a dummy variable a that is 1 if the responder accepts the offer and 0 if the responder rejects the offer. 

Using this we can create a best response function $U_R = a(t)$

Once the responder knows the value of t given by the proposer, he can pick the value of a to maximize the best response function, which will be accepting any t>0 and being indifferent when t=0.

### Question 2

Given that best response function, the proposer gets utility

$U_P = a(x-t)$ 

We know the value of a will be 1 if t>0, and since the responder would be indifferent if t=0, we assume that they would randomize with equal probability between accepting and rejecting. That means if t=0, then $U_P = .5(x)$ and if t>0 then $U_P = x-t$

If t>0, a will always be 1, and the proposer should try to minimize t. In this case, the minimal value of t where t>0 would be t=1.

So given the value of x, the proposer should pick the maximum of $.5(x)$ and $x-t$ to decide what they should do.
